<!-- Introduction to an interview on the show Event Horizon with Prof. Robert Prentner -->
The problem of consciousness revolves around the question of how and why subjective experiences correlate to physical systems. Why does activity in some parts of the brain, but not others, give rise to inner sensations and feelings? Why doesn’t it simply “go on in the dark”? Moreover, it became urgent to understand whether AI systems can be conscious. Unlike with biological brains, where we are confident that there is something like subjective experience going on, there is a great uncertainty whether AI systems indeed experience the world subjectively. Are they more like conscious human beings, or are they more like unconscious automata? 

The most prevalent belief in the field of consciousness studies is that one can start with the assumption that subjective experience somehow emerges from information processing within highly complex physical (perhaps only biological) systems. Accordingly, consciousness is booted up from unconscious ingredients. One problem with this view is that it has not delivered. Questions such as the above have not been answered for any specific case of subjective experience. What specific pattern of information processing corresponds to, say, the smell of Garlic? 

Another problem is that it is inconceivable how any such explanation, even if given, could be rigorously tested. Visualizing how information is being processed in a brain scan is not enough to decide whether it subjectively feels like something to process. Arguably, we need to be the system that processes the information. The question of consciousness seems to stand outside of science, forever bound to metaphysical speculation. 

However, there are alternatives to the prevalent way of thinking about the problem, and one such alternative is explored in this episode of Event Horizon. It is based on the idea that the things and structures we perceive as existing objectively “out there” are mere evolutionary adaptations that guide our behavior in a useful way. This includes things like space, time, or the concept of objects themselves. Those are mere artifacts of our way of interfacing with reality. As humans, we are naturally inclined to ask a further question: What exists beyond? The answer may involve consciousness, which many believe is not bound by the straightjacket of our interface. In this picture, our subjective experience points to a much larger process outside of our limited sense of reality. 

Specifically, we will talk about the following issues:
*	The problem of consciousness: subjective experience
*	The Interface Theory of Perception
*	Consciousness, dreams, and reality
*	Understanding and the limits of measurement
*	Roger Penrose’s view on quantum consciousness
*	AI consciousness 
*	Collective delusions and shared perceptions 
*	Astrobiology and consciousness in living systems
*	The necessity to integrate scientific fields to make progress
