<!-- ## Core commitments -->
* **Consciousness is fundamental** and exists in the relations around us, not merely “inside” our heads. We conceive it as a fundamental aspect of the relational substrate (RS) with which an agent interfaces. Thus, we reject any conflation of consciousness with the notion of a “ghost in the machine.”[^4]

*	**Interface consciousness** is not "consciousness as such" but refers to the process in which RS is mediated, filtered, coded, and made accessible to an agent.  The interface presents a “slice” of RS, resulting in a specific subjective experience (e.g., qualia, selfhood). Via interfaces consciousness agents are able to integrate with the world. We explicitly distance ourselves from purely internalist notions of consciousness. 

* **Relational substrate (RS)** is the fundamental, irreducible, and relational ground of an agent's reality. The immediate actuality of experience refers to this relational substrate[^1] — not as something "inside" agents, but as the external reality they access. 

<!-- *	**Consciousness (RS)** is the fundamental, external, and relational substrate of an agent's reality. Agents do not "have" consciousness; they structurally couple with RS via interfaces. On this view, consciousness is not an emergent property of internal computation or a "ghost in the machine."  We explicitly reject conflating (access to) RS with internalist or emergentist notions of consciousness. -->

*	**Subjective experience**, forming the "hard" part of the problem of consciousness, is like a desktop of a computer that gives us access to reality while hiding its underlying structure. Just as a computer’s desktop is but a user-friendly way of interacting with the deeper reality of the computer, our subjective experience is an evolved or designed “user-friendly” way to interact with RS. 

*	**AI consciousness is reframed**, not as a question of interiority or emergence, but as an exploration of interfaces to an agent’s reality. AI consciousness becomes “artificial interface consciousness.”

*	**Precursors in the philosophical literature** include Leibniz (“monads" as "living mirrors" of the universe), Kant (the "noumenon"), Schopenhauer (the “world-will”),  Husserl ("eidos", "intentionality"), or Whitehead (“processes,” “concrescence”). Consciousness is not “contained” in selves, but selves arise from consciousness.

* **The interface theory of perception (ITP)** proposes that perceptual systems evolved to prioritize survival-enhancing representations of reality, not to reveal objective (agent-independent) truths. ITP synthesizes computational models of perception with evolutionary biological principles.[^2] Building on this foundation, we aim to adapt ITP's core premise to develop AI agents that might similarly construct adaptive interfaces to RS.

* **Transcendental cosmology**: To fully understand how interface consciousness arises from interaction with RS, we need to explore the conditions of possibility of subjective experience. This leads to a "cosmological" approach, going beyond the confines of human-like subjectivity. 

*	**Artificial phenomenology** is the study and creation (engineering) of interfaces that encode first-person perspectives in (natural or artificial) systems.[^3] Mathematization is essential for bridging first-person experience and computational system design (for example, using tools from topology and category theory). 

*	**Our Goal**: develop a computational framework, formal models, and operational tests that clarify, engineer, and extend the ways in which agents—biological or artificial—could interface with RS.

*	**Integrates scholarship in the humanities** within a technology-driven research setting.

The following table summarizes the distinction between subjective experience, RS, and interface consciousness.

[^4]: On this view, subjective experience is not seen as an emergent property of internal computation but as the result of an interaction. 

[^1]: "Substrate" refers neither to a material base nor an object "below" experience, but rather to the non-objectifiable condition that makes experience possible at all. It is the metaphysical support for any possible interface, not a slab of matter underlying percepts.

[^2]: ITP has been developed and probed in a series of publications over the last 15 years. An authoritative review can be accessed here: [D.D. Hoffman, M. Singh, and C. Prakash. The Interface Theory of Perception, _Psychon Bull Rev_ *22*, 1480-1506, 2015.](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13423-015-0890-8) Our lab expands on the basic premises of ITP by connecting the theory to the study of AI consciousness. 

[^3]: This idea reframes the hard problem of consciousness: rather than asking whether AI (or the brain) possesses subjective experience intrinsically, artificial phenomenology examines how specific interface structures enable or shape “what-it-is-likeness” for an agent, grounded in a non-internalist, relational, reality-as-consciousness metaphysics.
