We seek passionate, intellectually curious collaborators who are 

* graduate/undergraduate students with project-relevant expertise
* independent scholars with interdisciplinary research interests
* coders interested in open-source tools for consciousness research

**Available Roles**[^1] 
 
`Interface Engineer`
  * develop SLP-tests to study AIs such as LLMs
  * design novel AR/VR or physical interfaces
  * requirements: experience in Python/PyTorch/JAX/Unity3D, interest in philosophy of consciousness beneficial 

`Mathematical Modeler`
  * build ontologies for agent-networks
  * work on the digital QNet-library
  * requirements: knowledgeable in applied mathematics (category theory and/or network theory) or background in physics, interest in computer science

`Computational Phenomenologist`
  * implement intentionality, time-consciousness, and self/world boundaries
  * relate 3rd-person data and 1st-person perspectives 
  * requirements: firm grasp of basic phenomenological concepts, working knowledge of computer science (this role particularly requires interaction with the other roles)
      
`Scholar of the Digital Humanities` 
  * relate theoretical concepts to specific case studies from the humanities (e.g., ethics, sociology of science, literature, or the history of religion)
  * design artefacts or exhibitions to illustrate the interface consciousness approach
  * passion for the relevant subfield of the humanities, interest in science and/or digital methods

<!--
`Physical Research Scientist`
 * applying the interface idea to empirical (physical) sciences
 * requirements: skilled in experimental physics/chemistry/biology, familiarity with the basics of lab work, and able to design new empirical protocols.
-->

   
`Outreach Specialist` (Volunteer/Project-Based)
  * helps build our community and disseminates research
  * manages social media/blog content 
  * maintains the group's web presence
  * organizes (virtual) workshops and seminars with partner institutions
  * crowdsource open-source tools or datasets for consciousness research

**What we offer**

* _Mentorship_: direct collaboration with the PI and interdisciplinary scholars
* _Skill development_: training in niche areas (e.g., category theory for consciousness science)
* _Academic impact_: publish in philosophy, AI, and cognitive science venues
* _Networking_ and _portfolio building_ opportunities
* _Flexibility_: part-time and remote work, modular projects, and adjustable timelines

**To apply** submit the following:

* CV/Resume (highlight relevant coursework or projects)
* Brief statement of interest (≤300 words)
* Preferred role and/or project ideas
* Optional: writing/code sample (e.g., philosophy essay, Python script, blog post)

[^1]: The above roles are meant as examples. Tasks could also be split among multiple researchers (e.g., there might be one engineer working on VR interfaces, while another engineer works with biological substrates). If you did not find a suitable role for you, please do not be afraid to contact us with a specific project in mind (e.g., "studying quantum-like structures of the interface"). However, we won't be able to accommodate unspecific proposals ("Hi Prof! Have you thought about _x_?")

**Deadlines**: rolling admissions. **Academic research visits and internships** (1-6 months) also available. Please [contact us](mailto:robert.prentner@amcs.science) to learn more.
