`Computational Phenomenologist`
  * implement intentionality, time-consciousness, and self/world boundaries
  * relate 3rd-person data and 1st-person perspectives 
  * requirements: firm grasp of basic phenomenological concepts, working knowledge of computer science

`Interface Engineer`
  * develop SLP-tests to study AIs such as LLMs
  * design novel AR/VR or physical interfaces
  * requirements: experience in Python/PyTorch/JAX/Unity3D, interest in philosophy of consciousness beneficial 

`Mathematical Modeler`
  * build ontologies for _Q_-networks
  * work on the digital _Q_Net-library
  * requirements: strong foundation in applied mathematics (category theory and/or network theory) or physics, interest in computer science

`Empirical Interface Scientist`
 * apply the interface consciousness framework to life and human sciences
 * design empirical protocols to study perception, embodiment, or subjectivity
 * requirements: background in neuroscience, psychology, cognitive science, or experimental biology; familiarity with lab methods and interest in conceptual modeling
   
`Technohumanities Scholar` 
  * relate theoretical concepts to specific case studies from the humanities (e.g., ethics, sociology of science, literature, or the history of religion)

**What we offer**

* _mentorship_: direct collaboration with the PI and interdisciplinary scholars
* _skill development_: training in niche areas (e.g., category theory for consciousness science)
* _interdisciplinary impact_: publish in philosophy, AI, and cognitive science venues
* _networking_ and _portfolio building_ opportunities
* _flexibility_: part-time and remote work, modular projects, and adjustable timelines

**To apply** submit the following:

* CV/resume (highlight relevant coursework or projects)
* brief statement of interest (≤300 words, including why you want to join)

* optional: writing/code sample (e.g., philosophy essay, Python script, blog post)

[^1]: The above roles are meant as examples. Tasks could also be split among multiple researchers. If you did not find a suitable role for you, please do not be afraid to contact us with a specific project in mind (e.g., "I want to study quantum-like structures of the interface because..."). However, we won't be able to accommodate unspecific proposals ("Hi Prof! Have you thought about _x_?")

**Deadlines**: rolling admissions. **Academic research visits and internships** (1-6 months) also available. Please [contact us](mailto:robert.prentner@amcs.science) to learn more.
