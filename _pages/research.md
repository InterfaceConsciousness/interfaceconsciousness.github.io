## Project A: Artificial Phenomenology from _Q_-networks


**Summary**: 
Translates data from brains or computers into a map of potential experiences ("_Q_-networks"). Uses advanced mathematics to analyze this map, revealing structures that align with the ontologies[^1] of subjective experience, such as a sense of self, time, and embodiment, incorporating Husserlian/Heideggerian themes.

<!--Models a network of interacting agents, formalizing their collective dynamics through ontologies[^1] to encode embodiments, spacetime, and selfhood. Implements this agent-based RS model in AI systems, then deploys category theory to bridge it with phenomenological frameworks, incorporating Husserlian/Heideggerian themes. -->

[^1]: Ontologies are understood as formal patterns or organizational schemes that specify how an agent perceives and interacts with the world.

**Type**: Theoretical (Phenomenology, Mathematics)

**Subprojects**:

*	_A1. Philosophical and Mathematical Synthesis_
*	_A2. Selves, Embodiment, and World Models_
* _A3. Spacetime from Agent-Networks_ 

**Most relevant publications of the group**: [Mathematized Phenomenology](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11097-025-10060-z), [Category Theory in Consciousness Science](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11229-024-04718-5), [Interfacing Consciousness](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1429376), [Fusions of Consciousness](https://doi.org/10.3390/e25010129), [Spacetime as error-correcting code](http://constructivist.info/12/3/265),	[Perceptual Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08101), [Phenomenal Spaces](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.concog.2019.02.002)

**Why it matters?** Anchors our research in philosophical concepts, enabling translation between phenomenological descriptions, AI architectures, and philosophy. Provides concrete, formal platforms for simulating and testing the emergence and properties of interfaces.<!--, preparing to bridge metaphysics and computational implementation.-->

## Project B: Interface Construction from Agent-Networks

**Summary**: Simulate and mathematically model RS as agent-networks whose collective dynamics can be captured by data structures[^1] that resemble embodiments, spacetime, and selves. This informs the design of interfaces by which (artificial and natural) systems could interact with RS. 


**Type**: Theory (Simulation, Network Theory)

**Subprojects**:

* *B1. Selves, Embodiment, and World Models*

* *B2. Spacetime from Agent-Networks* 

**Most relevant publications from the group**: [Interfacing Consciousness](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1429376), [Fusions of Consciousness](https://doi.org/10.3390/e25010129), [Spacetime as error-correcting code](http://constructivist.info/12/3/265),	[Perceptual Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08101), [Phenomenal Spaces](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.concog.2019.02.002)

**Why it matters?**: Provides concrete, formal platforms for simulating and testing the emergence and properties of interfaces, preparing to bridge metaphysics and computational implementation. Results feed into the other projects’ analyses and operationalization.

## Project B: SLP-Tests and Expanding the Interface

**Summary**: Transforms questions of artificial consciousness into operational tests (SLP-tests: subjective-linguistic, latent-emergent, phenomenological-structural) to evaluate the richness, coherence, and integrative capacity of (emergent) interfaces. Designs novel interfaces.

**Type**: Empirical (Engineering, Benchmarking)

**Subprojects**:

* _B1. SLP-Tests: Implementation and Validation_
* _B2. Subjective Grammar and Meaning in Language Models_
* _B3. Novel Interface Designs_  (experimental)

**Most relevant publications from the group**: [Artificial Consciouisness as Interface Representation](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2508.04383), [Interfacing Consciousness](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1429376), [Mathematized Phenomenology](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11097-025-10060-z)

**Why it matters?** Operationalizes metaphysical and phenomenological criteria in an empirical framework, allowing AI systems to be benchmarked for their relational richness. Extends our the interface paradigm to semantic and inter-agent domains, offering new experimental artifacts. Iteratively informs project A.

## Project C: Computational Humanities

<!--Connects the computational framework pursued in projects A and B with a broader perspective on the humanities. Facilitates the interpretation, reflection, and critique of all technical models and results in a non-technical context. -->
**Summary**:   Applies artificial phenomenology to model how interfaces mediate interpretation of cultural artifacts (texts, images, rituals). Develops digital tools to simulate historical subjectivities using SLP-test frameworks.
