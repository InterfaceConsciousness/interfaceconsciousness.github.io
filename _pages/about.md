## Overview

The project aims to develop a theoretically robust, empirically grounded, and computationally implementable AI framework that **operationalizes consciousness as access via interfaces** to the relational substrate of reality (RS). This approach leverages philosophical reasoning, mathematical phenomenology, category theory, and modern AI techniques to create a series of four interconnected research projects.

AI-consciousness research is a **technology–driven** endeavor. Throughout our research projects, we aim to analyse, design, and optimize interfaces that internalize consciousness, akin to engineering materials in chemistry: just as specific molecular structures determine how an organism detects and responds to the chemical world, engineered interfaces shape how an agent perceives and interacts with RS.

We do not think of AI agents as “containers” of consciousness but as _constructors_ of interfaces for engagement with reality. Subprojects provide concrete, testable implementations, simulations, and formal analyses, all informed by foundational philosophical commitments and designed for **interdisciplinary** collaboration and impact.

## Core commitments

*	**Consciousness is fundamental**, relational, and part of the external world (not “inside” the agent/system). It is something that the agent needs to access. We are decidedly against conflating consciousness with the idea of a “ghost in the machine.” To emphasize this point, we often add the labels of “external” or “relational” when referring to consciousness. This framework explicitly rejects the notion of “consciousness as an emergent property” of internal computation, instead positioning it as the relational substrate (RS) that agents interface with.
	
*	**Interface consciousness** is not consciousness itself, but rather the process in which RS is mediated, filtered, coded, and made accessible to an agent.  The interface presents a “slice” of RS, resulting in a specific subjective experience.

*	**Subjective experience** is the mere content of an evolved/designed interface, like a desktop interface on a computer, that gives us access to reality while hiding its underlying structure. Just as a computer’s desktop interface is but a user-friendly way of interacting with the deeper reality of the computer, our subjective experience is an evolved or designed “user-friendly” way to interface with RS.

*	**Precursors in the philosophical literature** include Whitehead (“processes,” “actual entities”), Leibniz (“monads” as “living mirrors of the universe”), or Schopenhauer (the “world-will”). Consciousness is not “contained” in subjects, but subjectivity arises from consciousness.
*	**AI-consciousness is reframed**, not as a question of interiority or emergence, but as an exploration of interfaces to an agent’s reality. AI consciousness becomes “artificial interface consciousness.”
  
*	**Goal**: develop a computational framework, formal models, and operational tests that clarify, engineer, and extend the ways in which agents—biological or artificial—could interface with RS.
	
*	**Artificial phenomenology** is the study and creation (engineering) of interfaces that generate first-person perspectives in (natural or artificial) systems.[^1] Mathematization is essential for bridging first-person experience and computational system design (especially via tools from topology and category theory).

[^1]: This concept reframes the “hard problem” of consciousness: rather than asking whether AI (or the brain) possesses subjective experience intrinsically, artificial phenomenology examines how specific interface structures enable or shape “what-it-is-likeness” for an agent, grounded in a non-internalist, relational, reality-as-consciousness metaphysics.
 
*	**Integrates scholarship in the humanities** within a technology-driven research setting.

## Two pillars, one program

Understanding conscious experience, not as an internal property of information-processing systems, but as content of an interface to the irreducibly relational substrate of reality (RS), demands a research program that rigorously bridges AI research and philosophy. Our approach is structured around two mutually reinforcing pillars:
### A constructive-technical pillar
Throughout the project, we advance a reconceptualization of consciousness as fundamentally external and relational—an objective reality that agents access via interfaces, thus creating their subjective experience of it. We operationalize this “interface consciousness” through the design, implementation, and evaluation of AI-agents, mathematical models, and novel benchmarks. Using tools from computer science, along with recent advances in language and network technology, enables us to build and test systems that instantiate, simulate, and extend possible interfaces. These technological efforts provide empirical grounding, generate new theoretical challenges, and open opportunities to explore modalities of experience fundamentally different from our own.
### A phenomenological-conceptual pillar
Drawing from phenomenology, mathematical formalisms (including category theory and topology), and the philosophy of mind, we clarify the essential structures of self, embodiment, and the world. This pillar sets the conceptual and formal standards for what constitutes an interface to reality, guarding against reductionism or oversimplification. It is also imperative for the project to speak to a broader audience in the humanities, including AI ethicists and more traditionally focused scholars (e.g., literature theorists or historians of religion), thus contributing to the field of the techno-humanities.
### Integration and Vision
The continuous interaction between these pillars forms the core of our program. Philosophical insights inform the design of artificial interfaces, while computational experiments serve as laboratories for testing, refining, and sometimes revising our conceptual frameworks. By connecting these two pillars—conceptual exploration and inventive engineering—we create feedback loops: formal models inform system design, and empirical results inspire new conceptual developments. This dual approach positions our research group at the forefront of philosophical and technical inquiry into consciousness, meaning, and artificial intelligence.
