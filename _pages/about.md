## Overview

The project aims to develop a theoretically robust, empirically grounded, and computationally implementable AI framework that **operationalizes consciousness as access via interfaces** to the relational substrate of reality (RS). This approach leverages philosophical reasoning, mathematical phenomenology, category theory, and modern AI techniques to create a series of four interconnected research projects.

AI-consciousness research is a **technology–driven** endeavor. Throughout our research projects, we aim to analyse, design, and optimize interfaces that internalize consciousness, akin to engineering materials in chemistry: just as specific molecular structures determine how an organism detects and responds to the chemical world, engineered interfaces shape how an agent perceives and interacts with RS.

We do not think of AI agents as “containers” of consciousness but as _constructors_ of interfaces for engagement with reality. Subprojects provide concrete, testable implementations, simulations, and formal analyses, all informed by foundational philosophical commitments and designed for **interdisciplinary** collaboration and impact.

## Core commitments

*	**Consciousness is fundamental**, relational, and part of the external world (not “inside” the agent/system). It is something that the agent needs to access. We are decidedly against conflating consciousness with the idea of a “ghost in the machine.” To emphasize this point, we often add the labels of “external” or “relational” when referring to consciousness. This framework explicitly rejects the notion of “consciousness as an emergent property” of internal computation, instead positioning it as the relational substrate (RS) that agents interface with.
	
*	**Interface consciousness** is not consciousness itself, but rather the process in which RS is mediated, filtered, coded, and made accessible to an agent.  The interface presents a “slice” of RS, resulting in a specific subjective experience.

*	**Subjective experience** is the mere content of an evolved/designed interface, like a desktop interface on a computer, that gives us access to reality while hiding its underlying structure. Just as a computer’s desktop interface is but a user-friendly way of interacting with the deeper reality of the computer, our subjective experience is an evolved or designed “user-friendly” way to interface with RS.

*	**Precursors in the philosophical literature** include Whitehead (“processes,” “actual entities”), Leibniz (“monads” as “living mirrors of the universe”), or Schopenhauer (the “world-will”). Consciousness is not “contained” in subjects, but subjectivity arises from consciousness.
*	**AI-consciousness is reframed**, not as a question of interiority or emergence, but as an exploration of interfaces to an agent’s reality. AI consciousness becomes “artificial interface consciousness.”
  
*	**Goal**: develop a computational framework, formal models, and operational tests that clarify, engineer, and extend the ways in which agents—biological or artificial—could interface with RS.
	
	*	**Artificial phenomenology** is the study and creation (engineering) of interfaces that generate first-person perspectives in (natural or artificial) systems.[^1] Mathematization is essential for bridging first-person experience and computational system design (especially via tools from topology and category theory).
  
*	**Integrates scholarship in the humanities** within a technology-driven research setting.

* **Technological-constructive pillar**
* **Phenomenological-conceptual pillar**
* **Integration and Vision**

[^1 This concept reframes the “hard problem” of consciousness: rather than asking whether AI (or the brain) possesses subjective experience intrinsically, artificial phenomenology examines how specific interface structures enable or shape “what-it-is-likeness” for an agent, grounded in a non-internalist, relational, reality-as-consciousness metaphysics.]
