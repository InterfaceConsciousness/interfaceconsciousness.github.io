## Overview

We **rethink consciousness as phenomenological bridge**: subjective experience emerges through an agent’s interface with the world. Our lab integrates computational methods, mathematical phenomenology, and the human sciences to build a constellation of projects that are theoretically rigorous, empirically grounded, and computationally implementable.

The study of consciousness should be **informed by science and technology**. Throughout our research projects, we aim to analyze, design, and optimize interfaces, akin to engineering materials in chemistry: just as specific molecular structures determine how an organism detects and responds to the chemical world, interfaces shape how an agent perceives and interacts with its environment.

Consciousness is not housed within agents but enacted through their interface with reality. Subprojects provide concrete, testable implementations, simulations, and formal analyses, all informed by foundational philosophical commitments and designed for **interdisciplinary collaboration and impact**.

## Two pillars, one program

Understanding (artificial) interface consciousness requires a research program that **bridges AI and philosophy**. Our work is structured around two mutually reinforcing pillars:

### A computational-constructive pillar
We treat consciousness as **relational**: accessing reality through an interface. This pillar focuses on the **design, implementation, and evaluation** of agents, mathematical models, and novel benchmarks. Using tools from computer science and recent advances in language and network technology, we build systems that simulate and test interface structures. These efforts generate empirical validation, theoretical challenges, and open up opportunities to explore new modes of experience.

### A phenomenological-conceptual pillar
Drawing from phenomenology, mathematics (e.g., category theory, topology), and the philosophy of mind, we clarify the essential structures of **self, body, and world**. This pillar sets the conceptual and formal standards for what constitutes an interface, guarding against reductionism and oversimplification. It engages a broad humanities audience across ethics, cultural studies, and history, contributing to the emerging field of **technohumanities**.

### Validation and vision
The dynamic interplay between these pillars drives our program. Philosophical insights guide system design; computational experiments test and refine conceptual frameworks. Feedback between **conceptual exploration** and **inventive engineering** positions our lab at the forefront of inquiry into consciousness, meaning, and artificial intelligence.
