## Overview

The lab **rethinks consciousness as a phenomenological bridge**. Subjective experience is enacted through an agent’s interface to the world. Our approach integrates computational methods with mathematical phenomenology and the human sciences to create a constellation of research projects that are _theoretically robust, empirically grounded, and computationally implementable_. 

The study of consciousness should be **informed by science and technology**. Throughout our research projects, we aim to analyze, design, and optimize interfaces, akin to engineering materials in chemistry: just as specific molecular structures determine how an organism detects and responds to the chemical world, interfaces shape how an agent perceives and interacts with its environment.

We do not think of agents as “containers” of consciousness but as _constructors_ of interfaces for the engagement with reality. Subprojects provide concrete, testable implementations, simulations, and formal analyses, all informed by foundational philosophical commitments and designed for **interdisciplinary collaboration and impact**.

## Two pillars, one program

Understanding (artificial) interface consciousness demands a research program that rigorously bridges AI research and philosophy.  Our approach is therefore structured around two mutually reinforcing pillars:

### A computational-constructive pillar
Throughout the project, we think of consciousness as relational — grounding a reality that is accessed via interfaces. We approach this through the **design, implementation, and evaluation** of agents, mathematical models, and novel benchmarks. Using tools from computer science, along with recent advances in language and network technology, allows us to build and test systems that instantiate, simulate, and extend possible interfaces. These technological efforts provide empirical validation, generate new theoretical challenges, and open up opportunities to explore forms of experience that are fundamentally different from our own.
### A phenomenological-conceptual pillar
Drawing from phenomenology, mathematics (including category theory and topology), and the philosophy of mind, we clarify the essential structures of **self, body, and world**. This pillar sets the conceptual and formal standards for what constitutes an interface, guarding against reductionism or oversimplification. It is also imperative for the project to speak to a broader audience in the humanities, including AI ethicists and more traditionally focused scholars (e.g., literature theorists or historians of religion), thus contributing to the field of the **technohumanities**.
### Validation and vision
The continuous interaction between these pillars forms the core of our program. Philosophical insights inform the design of artificial interfaces, while computational experiments serve as laboratories for testing, refining, and sometimes revising our conceptual frameworks. By connecting these two pillars—conceptual exploration and inventive engineering—we create feedback loops: **formal models inform system design, and empirical results inspire new conceptual developments**. This dual approach positions our research group at the forefront of philosophical and technical inquiry into consciousness, meaning, and artificial intelligence.
